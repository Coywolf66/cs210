Airgead Banking App Project Overview
Project Summary

Description:
The Airgead Banking App is a collaborative initiative developed with a local high school to create an interactive C++ application. This educational tool is designed to teach high school students the foundational principles of fiscal responsibility, focusing on investments and compound interest. Users can input investment amounts, interest rates, and investment durations to see projections of potential earnings. The hands-on approach of the app aims to illustrate the power of compound interest, empowering students to take charge of their financial futures.
Reflection on the Project:
Achievements:
Compound Interest Logic: The implementation of compound interest calculations showcased my attention to accuracy and efficiency, enhancing the real-time update feature and significantly improving the user experience.
User Interface (UI): The intuitive design of the UI allows students to easily navigate and utilize the app, even without prior financial knowledge.

Opportunities for Improvement:
Financial Scenarios: While the app currently handles basic financial calculations well, it could be improved by incorporating more complex scenarios, such as fluctuating interest rates and the impact of different taxations on investment returns.
Implementation Plan: Plans to enhance the application include updating the calculation module to accommodate additional parameters and integrating an API for dynamic, real-time financial data.

Challenges Overcome:
Handling Complex Inputs: Ensuring the application's robustness against various, including incorrect and non-standard, user inputs was a significant challenge. This was addressed by implementing comprehensive input validation checks and exception handling, with online forums and C++ documentation proving crucial resources.

Development Skills Enhanced:
Programming Proficiency: This project was an excellent opportunity to refine my C++ programming skills, incorporating elements of data management and user interface development.
Problem-solving and Project Management: I improved my abilities in planning, executing, and iterating on software development projects, enhancing my problem-solving and project management skills.

Code Maintainability:
Commenting and Documentation: Every function and module within the application is thoroughly commented to explain the logic and purpose, aiding future maintenance or enhancements.
Modular Design: The applicationâ€™s architecture is modular, allowing individual parts to be updated independently without affecting others.
